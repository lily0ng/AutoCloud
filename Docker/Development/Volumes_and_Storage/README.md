# Docker Volumes and Storage Examples

This project demonstrates different approaches to managing data persistence in Docker using volumes and storage options.

## Project Structure
- `bind-mount-example/`: Example of using bind mounts
- `named-volume-example/`: Example using named volumes
- `tmpfs-example/`: Example using tmpfs mounts
- `docker-compose.yml`: Combined example using different volume types
- `Volumes_and_Storage.md`: Detailed documentation of volume concepts

## Volume Types Demonstrated
1. Named Volumes
2. Bind Mounts
3. tmpfs Mounts
4. Anonymous Volumes
5. Multi-container shared volumes

## Running the Examples
Each directory contains its own example that can be run independently. Use the docker-compose.yml file to run all examples together.
